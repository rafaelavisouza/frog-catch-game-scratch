# Frog Catch Game 🐸🪰
**CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science - Problem Set 0**

This is my first project for **Harvard University's CS50x**, an introductory course on computer science and the art of programming. The project was developed using **Scratch** to explore fundamental computational thinking concepts.

## 📝 About the Project
In this game, the player controls a hungry frog trying to catch insects falling from the sky. It serves as a practical application of core programming principles:
* **Score System:** Uses variables to track performance and determine game states.
* **Dynamic Gameplay:** Implements loops and clones to handle three insects falling simultaneously.
* **Sound & Visual Feedback:** Custom sound effects and costume changes based on conditional logic.
* **Game Over Mechanics:** A special "dead frog" costume and soundtrack are triggered if the score drops below zero.

## 🎮 How to Play
* **Left/Right Arrow Keys:** Move the frog across the screen.
* **Objective:** Catch as many insects as possible.
* **Challenge:** Don't let your score hit negative numbers, or it's Game Over!

## 🛠️ Concepts Applied
* **Conditionals:** If/then logic for scoring and game termination.
* **Variables:** Real-time data management for the score.
* **Event Handling:** Responding to keyboard inputs and sprite collisions.
* **Loops:** Continuous motion and sprite generation.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Download the `project.sb3` file.
2. Open the [Scratch Online Editor](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/).
3. Go to **File > Load from your computer** and select the file.
